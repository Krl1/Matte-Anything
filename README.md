## 📜 Introduction

[Segment Anything Model (SAM)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) is a powerful segmentation model that can generate segmentation masks with user interaction. However, SAM is restricted in capturing detailed object boundaries. To overcome this issue, we propose a simple framework, named Matte Anything. Specifically, we combine SAM with the image matting model [ViTMatte](https://github.com/hustvl/ViTMatte). In the framework, SAM could provide high-quality target guidance to ViTMatte, enabling it to generate fine-grained masks and foregrounds.

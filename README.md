## üìú Introduction

We propose Matte Anything (MatAny), an interactive natural image matting model. It could produce high-quality alpha-matte with various simple hints. The key insight of MatAny is to generate pseudo trimap automatically with contour and transparency prediction. We leverage task-specific vision models to enhance the performance of natural image matting.

### Quick Installation

Install [Segment Anything Models](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) as following:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything.git
```

Install [ViTMatte](https://github.com/hustvl/ViTMatte) as following:
```
python -m pip install 'git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2.git'
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install [GroundingDINO](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO) as following:
```
cd Matte-Anything
git clone https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO.git
cd GroundingDINO
pip install -e .
```

Download pretrained models [SAM_vit_h](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth), [ViTMatte_vit_b](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d97oKuITCeWgai2Tf3iNilt6rMSSYzkW/view?usp=sharing), and [GroundingDINO-T](https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO/releases/download/v0.1.0-alpha/groundingdino_swint_ogc.pth). Put them in ``./pretrained_models``

### Run our web-ui!
```
python matte_anything.py
```

### How to use
1. Upload the image and click on it (default: ``foreground point``).
2. Click ``Start!``.
3. Modify ``erode_kernel_size`` and ``dilate_kernel_size`` for a better trimap (optional).
